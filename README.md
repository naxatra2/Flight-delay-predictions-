# Flight Delay Prediction

Airlines face a complex challenge in maximizing profitability while managing multiple operational areas, such as flight scheduling, ground crew efficiency, fuel management, and passenger services. Given strict regulations and fluctuating fuel costs, optimizing these processes is essential for minimizing delays, improving turnaround times, and boosting overall performance. Airlines must carefully plan maintenance schedules to minimize downtime without compromising safety. Balancing preventive maintenance with revenue-generating flights is delicate

We have used `ResNet-50` for **Flight Delay Prediction** and `Genetic Algorithm` for **Flight Rescheduling**

## Running the Notebooks Locally

To run these notebooks in any development environment, ensure you have the required libraries installed. Below is a list of libraries which will be used in this notebook:

### Required Libraries

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
numpy: For numerical operations and array handling
scikit-learn: A robust toolkit for machine learning algorithms
matplotlib: For data visualization and plotting
tensorflow and keras: For deep learning and neural network models
deap: For evolutionary algorithms, useful in optimization tasks
torch: for using neural network models

## Installation Instructions

If you do not already have these libraries installed, you can install them by running the following command:

```sh
!pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow keras deap pytorch
```
This command installs all the required packages in your environment. Once installed, you can seamlessly run the notebooks locally, leveraging these tools for data processing, model training, visualization, and optimization

## Setup Instructions
Please ensure that your dataset and code files are organized correctly. Upload the required .zip file containing the CSV data files and any relevant code files into the same folder where these notebooks are located. This structure allows the notebooks to easily access and load data without additional path configuration
